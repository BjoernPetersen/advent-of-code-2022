# aoc-2022

Wanted to do this in Swift, but Jetbrains doesn't have a (non-mobile development, non-Mac) IDE
for it.

## Prerequisites

Python 3.11 and Poetry 1.2.0+

## Installation

```shell
poetry install
```

## Usage

Run the first task of day 1 with the input in the inputs directory:
```shell
aoc day 1 task 1
```

Run the second task of day 12 with your own input:
```shell
aoc day 12 task 2 --input myinput.txt
```
